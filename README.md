# allspice
A framework to season any program, or system.

What if everything in the world could be controlled from one place? And everything could be instantly and easily configured with simple voice commands, push buttons, or via a chat, mobile or browser based app?  The framework to make this possible could be called AllSpice.

It would enable control of any IOT device (via the Multiversal Remote), or any Enterprise service (via the Bridge) leveraging the MCP (Master Control Program) which is a Policy Definition Portal (or PDP).
